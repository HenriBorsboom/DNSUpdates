For the Ansible DNS runbooks to work successfully in a LAB environment, the following needs to be setup.

1. Domain Controller
Copy the files under DC\Program Files to the Domain controller under C:\Program Files
Create a ServiceAccounts OU in AD
Run the Setup-DNSServiceAccount.ps1 file to create the service account
Run the Setup.ps1 file to register the JEA session, assign Read + Execute permissions on the service account, and setup winrm to listen on HTTPS
Create a bank.local DNS zone with mydummyhost A record
Create a bank DNS zone and an int domain under bank. Create a CNAME record called dummyalias that points to mydummyhost.bank.local

2. Jump server
Add the service account as local admin
Copy the Scripts folder under Jump to C:\Scripts
Run Setup-WinRM-HTTPS.ps1 to set WinRM to listen on HTTPS
gpedit.msc
    Computer Configuration/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Local Policies/user Rights Assignment
        Deny log on as a batch job
        Deny log on as a service
        Deny log on locally
        Deny log on through Remote Desktop Service

3. Ansible
Install krb5-user and ansible
    sudo apt clean && sudo apt update -y && sudo apt upgrade -y && apt install ansible krb5-user -y
Create the playbooks folder on the server
    mkdir ~/playbooks/
Copy the yml files to ~/playbooks/
    scp ./Ansible/*.yml slash@192.168.101.117:/home/slash/playbooks
